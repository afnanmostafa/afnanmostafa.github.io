Greetings! Thank you for visiting. I hope it's not a complete waste of your time. Here's a bit about me: I'm an avid Formula 1 enthusiast and a proud papaya (McLaren) fan! Ayrton Senna, in my view, remains the greatest motorsport driver in history. On a more academic note, I'm a graduate student at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), working on NSF-funded research exploring phase transitions in materials under extreme conditions under the guidance of [Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/sites/abdolrahim/).

I recently earned my MS from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst)](https://www.umass.edu/),  where I had the privilege of working on [U.S. Army Research Laboratory](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/)-funded projects aimed at developing graphene-nanodiamond composites with enhanced mechanical and thermal properties. This work was conducted under the mentorship of [Dr. Ashwin Ramasubramaniam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m_vW2OUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Dimitrios Maroudas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=djdYARAAAAAJ&hl=en).

I completed my B.Sc. at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/)in October 2018, which laid the foundation for my career in engineering. Following my degree, I worked as an HVAC Design Coordinator and Project Supervisor at MEP Design Studio, where I gained practical experience in the field.

Hobbies: Learning new software tools and reflecting on how fortunate we are as humans to have come this far!

Short-term Goal: To keep learning and growing each day, both academically and personally.

Long-term Goal: To use my knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to the world.

Dream: To work as a research engineer or scientist at NASA! (After all, no harm in dreaming big, right?)

#### Fun Facts:

I’m a passionate movie lover, especially when it comes to Sci-Fi and mind-bending films. In my view, <span style="color:#FF9900">Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey</span> stands as the greatest Sci-Fi movie of all time. If you disagree, compare it to its sequel, <span style="color:#FF9900">2010: The Year We Make Contact</span>; the difference is like night and day, reflecting on Kubrick's unparalleled impact.

I’m also a sports enthusiast, with Badminton as my longtime favorite. Beyond that, I love watching and following F1, soccer, the NBA, cricket, and, of course, enjoy playing video games (I peaked plat 3 in Valorant with no routine).

Oh, before you go, repeat after me: <span style="color:#FF9900">Messi is the greatest of all time, INDEED.</span>

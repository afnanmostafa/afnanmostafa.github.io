# Graduate (MS) Thesis
**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Title:</span>** Thermal Conductivity and Mechanical Properties of Interlayer-Bonded Graphene Bilayers [Link](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/1337/)  
**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Supervisors:</span>** Dr. Ashwin Ramasubramaniam & Dr. Dimitrios Maroudas  

**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Summary:</span>** Graphene, an allotrope of carbon, demonstrates exceptional properties that can be enhanced through structural modifications. This thesis presents molecular dynamics studies to understand the thermomechanical response of interlayer-bonded graphene bilayers. Key findings reveal that controlling interlayer C-C bond density can precisely tune the in-plane thermal conductivity of these superstructures, which has implications for thermal management. Additionally, we observe a brittle-to-ductile transition in IB-TBG structures under shear deformation, contrasting with RD-IBG sheets which exhibit brittle failure. The study contributes significantly to understanding graphene-based mechanical metamaterials.

# Undergraduate Thesis
**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Title:</span>** Uniaxial and Cyclic Stress-Strain Behavior of Lead-Free Solders at Nano-scale [Link](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/2324/1/030024/1027371/Uniaxial-and-cyclic-stress-strain-behavior-of-lead?redirectedFrom=fulltext)  
**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Supervisor:</span>** Dr. Mohammad Abdul Motalab  

**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Summary:</span>** This research examines the cyclic and uniaxial stress-strain behavior of lead-free solders (SAC alloy) at the nanoscale level using LAMMPS simulations. Key parameters like temperature, strain limits, and alloy composition were analyzed for their effects on the material’s stress-strain behavior. Findings indicate that increasing temperature or lowering strain rates results in increased plastic strain range and decreased peak stress. This study provides insights into damage accumulation in solder joints, with implications for improving the reliability of electrical assemblies.

# Selected Undergraduate Project
**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Project Title:</span>** Designing and Building a Smart Wheelchair

**<span style="color:#7FCEC2">Summary:</span>** This project involved designing a smart wheelchair with the goal of easing movement for individuals with physical impairments. The wheelchair, controlled with fingertip movements, includes motors for directional control, PWM for speed adjustments, and safe turning mechanisms. Future upgrades may include additional features for enhanced usability. Our intent was to create an accessible, cost-effective solution that could have a positive impact on the local market.

Greetings! Here's a bit about me: I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and a proud papaya fan! I believe Ayrton Senna was the greatest motorsport driver in history. In all seriousness, I am a graduate student at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/). I am working on NSF-funded projects on phase transitions in materials in extreme conditions under the supervision of [Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/sites/abdolrahim/).

I recently completed my MS at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst)](https://www.umass.edu/), where I was fortunate to contribute to projects funded by the [Army Research Laboratory](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/), focused on developing graphene-nanodiamond composites with enhanced mechanical and thermal properties under the guidance of [Dr. Ashwin Ramasubramaniam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m_vW2OUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Dimitrios Maroudas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=djdYARAAAAAJ&hl=en).

I earned my B.Sc. at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) in October 2018. Afterward, I gained practical experience as an HVAC Design Coordinator and Project Supervisor at MEP Design Studio. 

__Hobbies:__ Learning new software tools and reflecting on how fortunate we are as humans to have come this far!

__Short-term Goal:__ To keep learning and growing each day, both academically and personally.

__Long-term Goal:__ To use my knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to the world.

__Dream:__ To work as a research engineer or scientist at NASA! (After all, there’s no harm in dreaming big, right?)

#### Fun Facts:

I’m a passionate movie lover, especially when it comes to Sci-Fi and mind-bending films. In my view, <span style="color:#FF9900">Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey</span> stands as the greatest Sci-Fi movie of all time. If you disagree, compare it to its sequel, <span style="color:#FF9900">2010: The Year We Make Contact</span>; the difference is like night and day, reflecting on Kubrick's unparalleled impact.

I’m also a sports enthusiast, with Badminton as my longtime favorite. Beyond that, I love watching and following F1, soccer, the NBA, cricket, and, of course, enjoy playing video games (I peaked plat 3 in Valorant with no routine).

Oh, before you go, repeat after me: <span style="color:#FF9900">Messi is the greatest of all time, INDEED.</span>

Greetings! A little about me: I am a graduate student at the University of Rochester, working on NSF-funded projects on phase transitions in materials in extreme conditions under the supervision of Dr. Niaz Abdolrahim.

Recently, I graduated with an MS from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), where I was fortunate enough to work on various projects under the guidance of Dr. Ashwin Ramasubramaniam and Dr. Dimitrios Maroudas. Army Research Laboratory funded the projects wherein the primary objective was to develop graphene-nanodiamond composites with superior mechanical and thermal properties.

I completed my B.Sc. from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) on October 22, 2018. Then, I worked as an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Design Coordinator and Project Supervisor at MEP Design Studio for a while. 

Hobby: Learning new software tools and discussing with people how lucky human beings are to come this far!!

__Short-term Goal:__ Learning more and more and trying to be a better person each day

__Long-term Goal:__ Contributing to the world with my knowledge and expertise.

__Dream:__ A research engineer/scientist at NASA!! [no harm in dreaming big, right?]

#### Some Facts: 

I am a movie-loving person, especially the ones relating to the Sci-Fi and mind-twisting genres. I am also a sport-maniac, and Badminton has been my go-to for years.

I love F1, soccer, NBA, cricket, and playing video games.
